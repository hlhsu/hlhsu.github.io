								<h2 style="text-align: left;">Machine Learning Research Intern, Human Interaction Laboratory</h2>
								<p style="text-align:left;">
									After I switched my research direction from mechanism design to machine learning/ reinforcement learning for two years in my master's life, I was reached out by Mr. Shohei Sato, the HR manager of Reazon Holdings, inc., and then
									I worked as a <b>ML research intern</b> in <b>Human Interaction Laboratory</b> with my colleagues on developing accurate "Eye-tracking" technology that can be used without constraints in real-time on mobile devices with 
									reasonable cameras and processing abilities with minimal or no calibration. I built different convolutional neural network models with real-world data, aiming to improve the performance in accuracy and running time. I successfully
									demonstrated that GhostNet is promising from our results. In addition, I abstracted the original PyTorch implementation in the research lab via PyTorch Lightning so that the codes can be more flexible and with fewer mistakes.
									
									</br></br>This was my first ML research internship in the industry, which gives me the chance to understand the difference between academia and industry in working on machine learning. For example, we mainly seek to maximize the accuracy during learning
									on campus while researchers in the industry should also consider the running time for evaluation to achieve real-time detection on mobile devices, which is a trade-off with accuracy. I was also getting more mature in collaborating with others
									on an industry project. Please refer to my <a href="internship/reazon/Reazon_Holdings_Internship_Report.pdf" style="color:blue"> (internship report)</a> for details.

								<h2>Software Engineering Intern, Abbott Vascular Taiwan</h2>
								<p style="text-align:left;">
									   At the end of my undergraduate studies, I was recommended by my advisor, Prof. Hao-Ming Hsiao to become a <b>Software Engineering Intern</b> at <b>Abbott Vascular Taiwan</b>.
									   I worked full-time and part-time for 13 months. In addition to improving the operation time in the sales database of vascular products, I also develop a new administrative system
									   to share information among the marketing, sales, and finance departments. Eventually, my colleagues are able to forecast vascular product marketing trends by digitizing routine documents
									   and  I also incorporated the original database with Power BI to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities to create reports and dashboards.
									   </br></br> It was my pleasure to work with those supportive mentors and colleagues, and We have a lively atmosphere in the office. I completed my internship journey at Abbott by giving a presentation
                                                                           to the general manager at Abbott Vascular Taiwan. I researched the design, simulation, and manufacturing of stents in the lab. I was fortunate to also get familiar with vascular products
                                                                           from different perspectives during this internship.
