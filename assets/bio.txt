Hao-Lun Hsu is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Duke University, advised by Prof. Miroslav Pajic. His research is centered around developing fundamental algorithms for autonomous agents with two main thrusts: (1) enhancing single-agent capabilities, such as robustness, exploration, and adaptation; (2) enabling scalable coordination and communication in multi-agent systems. He is particularly interested in the intersection between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and foundation models with applications spanning across robotics, healthcare, and web-based task automation. He was a NSF TAST-NRT Fellow supported with surgical robotics research. Before his journey at Duke, he earned a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from National Taiwan University and a M.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Beyond his academic pursuits, he was a Diversity Ambassador at Georgia Institute of Technology dedicated to advancing the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
