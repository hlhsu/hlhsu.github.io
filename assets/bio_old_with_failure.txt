Hao-Lun Hsu is currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Duke University, under the guidance of Prof. Miroslav Pajic. 
His research is centered around the intersection of provable and practical decision-making, specifically in the realms of reinforcement learning (RL)
and multi-armed bandits (MAB). His primary focus lies in the domains of robust and sample-efficient RL, with applications spanning across robotics, 
neuroscience, energy systems, and quantum computing. He was a NSF TAST-NRT Fellow supported with surgical robotics research.
