	We propose the world’s first spherical stent,which can be deployed in the upstream of an artery
	to reduce the blood flow to the downstream cancer cells. Computational models were developed to
	predict the device’s mechanical integrity and hemodynamic occlusion performance. Simulation
	results suggested that devices with the metal density of 14-27% would reduce the average blood flow
	rate by 30-50%. Conceptual prototypes were made with a series of manufacturing procedures and
	tested by flow experiments for proof of concept. Experimental results showed that the spherical stent
	with the metal density of 27% was able to reduce 44% of the flow, which agreed well with the
	simulation results.
